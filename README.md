### User Stories

* As an Epicodus student, I want an easily navigable site so that I can quickly search/find the information that I need.
* As a non-Epicodus student/developer, I want easy access to relevant notes and lessons in each track in the form of a navigation bar/menu so that I can switch between references quickly.
* Other target audiences: parents, Epicodus teachers/admin, other coding bootcamp students/admins
